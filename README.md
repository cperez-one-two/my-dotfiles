# My Dotfiles

Some dotfiles I like to keep version controlled across my machines. Includes a simple script that will symlink the folders in this repo to `$HOME/.config`.

# Installation

Simply clone the repo and run the install script.
```sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

## macOS Installation

There is a separate folder for macOS-specific configurations. If you're on macOS, use these instead.

``` sh
$ cd .macos
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```
